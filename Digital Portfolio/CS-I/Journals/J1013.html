    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction {\displaystyle \not \equiv }{\displaystyle \not \equiv }?</h3>
    <p> The output is true if either of the inputs are true but both are not true.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula {\displaystyle 2^{n}}{\displaystyle 2^{n}}?</h3>
    <p>The formula is because there are 2n possible combinations of truth values, true or false. It is only related to input because the output is determined by the inputs.</p>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned basic operations for boolean algebra.</p>
    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when...trying to solve the equations myself.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved through me getting more practice and experience in solbing boolean algebra, and perhaps a walkthrough done in person.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
        <p>I figured out how boolean algebra works..</p>
