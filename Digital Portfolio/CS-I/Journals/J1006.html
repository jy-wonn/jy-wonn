    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3> What is Git communicating to you? </h3>
    <h3>What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <h3>Why do you think this is?</h3>
   <p> It creates a snapshot of all staged objects.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt?</h3>
    <h3>How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <h3>Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>They are not, because they are different files, and have not been grouped together.</p>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt?</h3>
    <h3>How are they displayed in git status? Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>It states they are untracked.</p>
    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <h3>What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>We are now in a directory called Merlin</p>
    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>Execute the commands. What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>This shows what has been added to the index and staged for a commit.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned more about source controls and the commands used.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when...indentifying what the code changed</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by...more practice on my end.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
        <p>I learnt another vital part of tabby, and will continue to use it in the future.</p>
