    <h1>CS-I Journal J1012: Alternative Base Addition</h1>
    <p>Name: Sreesha Srinivasan</p>
    <p>Date: Sept-2022</p>


    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p> Align the digits vertical and add the right-most column.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>Numbers greater than can be represented by a single digit have to be carried over..</p>
    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3> Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p> If number is greater than the quantity that can be represented by a single digit, we carry.</p>
    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>The resulting numbers cannot be greater than 1, so you have to keep carrying.</p>
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned about alternative base addition and how to do it.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when...trying to solve the equations myself</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by...getting a walkthrough or just watching more videos on this myself.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I have realized there many places for me to mess up, and I need to be more careful.</p>
