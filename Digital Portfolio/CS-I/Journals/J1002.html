    <h2>Section 8</h2>
    <h3>What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?

    <p>The tree shows all the directories branched out, and ls shows the current prompt</p>

    <h2>Section 9</h2>

      What do you think it means to run a job in the background?

    <p>I learned about the basic commands</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when...trying to run some of these new commands</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by...slowing down and taking time to understand</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that...coding is really complicated, and I'm only doing the basics right now.</p>
